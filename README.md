# animal-crossing
Animal Crossing Flutter Project, inspired by discussion in #animal-crossing on goof machine. 

It would be nice to have an ad-free, simple Animal Crossing compananion App for monitoring things like bugs/fish/fossils collected, and if you've made youe own version of them (for example, for building in your T-Rex to display).

Also want to incorporate in Turnip Prophet, and extend feature set to include group max/mins. May need to rewrite the whole thing in another language, who knows.

Maybe there's are other open source apps from which we can start. Plan is to use Flutter, to allow for maximum platform flexibility.
